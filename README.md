# Prediction of Bike Sharing Usage based on Citibike New York Data in 2018

A brief analysis trying to predict bike sharing usage.

Arrivals: number of trips that end at a station per day. 

Departures: number of trips that start at a station per day. 

Characteristic bike sharing usage: prediction of bike sharing usage at a specific location, given that there are no bike stations in a vicinity of the location.

The plots are html files using Google Maps API and gmplot. Please download and open in a new tab to see the plots. The available plots demonstrate the stations with the highest Departures and Arrivals. 

The predictive models are built by using Keras. Please make sure Keras is available to make predictions.

This is a python library in process. Currently, the available function is to predict the characteristic bike sharing usage given one or more coordinates in the form of a pandas dataframe.

An example and other functions will be updated soon.

A brief analysis trying to predict daily trip numbers related to a citibike station.

Start-frequency/end-frequency is defined to be the number of trips that start/end at a station per day. 

The plots are html files using Google Maps API and gmplot. Please open in a new tab to see the plots.

Currently, the available plots demonstrate the stations with the highest star-frequencies and end-frequencies. Please download to view the plots.
